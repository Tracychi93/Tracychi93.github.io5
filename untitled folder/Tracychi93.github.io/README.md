    <h1>HTML is Fun</h1>
    <p>The topic that I found interesting is <strong>Void Elements</strong>.<br />
       Some Elements consist  open tag, content, and a  closing tag.<br />
       However, Some elements consist a single tag which is used to embed image file onto a 	 
       page.<br />
       
       This is my first HTML, and It is a great experience.<p >
       I found the interesting topic from "Getting Started with HTML".<br /> 
       <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#active_learning_adding_attributes_to_an_element"> Click Here</a> to get into the website to learn about the HTML concept.
